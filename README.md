## Project Description
Sales prediction is crucial for businesses to optimize their advertising strategies and budget. In this project, we build a **Linear Regression** model to predict sales based on advertising costs.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction-python.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sales-prediction-python
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Advertising.csv** which contains data on advertising spend and corresponding sales figures.

- **Dataset Name**: `Advertising.csv`
- [Download the Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv)

## Code and Analysis
The notebook (`.ipynb`) and Python script (`.py`) files include the code used for:
- Loading and exploring the dataset.
- Performing feature engineering and checking for missing values.
- Training a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluating model performance and visualizing results.

## Results
Key results from the analysis include:
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**:
    - Mean Squared Error: `{{ mse }}`
    - R^2 Score: `{{ r2 }}`
- **Visualization**:
    - Actual Sales vs Predicted Sales:

## How to Run
1. To run the project, open the `sales_prediction.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step.
2. If using the Python script:
    ```bash
    python sales_prediction.py
    ```

Make sure the dataset (`Advertising.csv`) is in the same directory as the notebook or script.
